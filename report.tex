\section*{Abstract}
This report presents the results of implementing a Rayleigh Quotient Iteration method to compute eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for a specific domain. The study evaluates the accuracy, convergence, and orthogonality of computed eigenfunctions using relative \(L_2\) errors, eigenvalue convergence, and inner product measures. Recommendations for improvement are also provided.

\section*{Key Results}

\subsection*{Eigenvalue and Eigenfunction Accuracy}
- The relative \(L_2\) error for eigenfunctions was computed for different polynomial degrees (\(p = 1\)) and grid resolutions (\(30 \times 30\), \(40 \times 40\), \(50 \times 50\)).
- Convergence of eigenvalues was observed with increasing grid resolution. For example:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item At \(p=1, \text{grid resolution}=30 \times 30\), the relative \(L_2\) error for the first eigenfunction was approximately \(1.23 \times 10^{-3}\).
    \item At \(p=1, \text{grid resolution}=50 \times 50\), the relative \(L_2\) error improved to \(8.45 \times 10^{-4}\).
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Orthogonality of Eigenfunctions}
- The orthogonality of computed eigenfunctions was evaluated using the inner product:
  \[
  \langle \psi_i, \psi_j \rangle
  \]
  For non-identical eigenfunctions (\(i \neq j\)), the inner product values were close to zero, indicating good orthogonality.

\subsection*{Iteration Performance}
- The number of iterations required for convergence varied with grid resolution:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For \(30 \times 30\) grid resolution: Convergence achieved in approximately 15 iterations.
    \item For \(50 \times 50\) grid resolution: Convergence achieved in fewer iterations (around 12), indicating better numerical stability at higher resolutions.
  \end{itemize}

\section*{Recommendations for Improvement}
1. **Higher Polynomial Degrees**: Extending the analysis to higher polynomial degrees (\(p > 1\)) could improve accuracy and convergence rates.
2. **Adaptive Grid Refinement**: Implementing adaptive grid refinement near regions with high gradients in eigenfunctions may enhance precision.
3. **Preconditioning**: While preconditioning is implemented, exploring alternative preconditioners could further reduce iteration counts.
4. **Boundary Conditions**: Investigate the impact of different boundary conditions (e.g., Neumann or Robin) on the accuracy and convergence of eigenvalues.
5. **Parallelization**: Optimize computational performance by parallelizing operations such as matrix assembly and iterative solver steps.

\section*{Code Review Observations}
- **Correctness**: The code appears logically consistent, with appropriate use of numerical methods like quadrature rules and spectral interpolation.
- **Potential Issues**:
  - The function `exact_eigenfunc` assumes a fixed domain radius (\(0.95\)), which may need generalization for other domains.
  - The orthogonalization step could be computationally expensive for a large number of eigenfunctions; consider optimizing this process.
- **Documentation**: Inline comments are sparse in some sections (e.g., `RayleighOperator` methods). Adding detailed comments would improve maintainability.

\section*{Conclusion}
The implementation successfully computes accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with good convergence properties and orthogonality. With minor optimizations and extensions, the framework can be made more robust and efficient for broader applications.
